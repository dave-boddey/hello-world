# hello-world
My first repository

Hi All
Dave here on my first journey into programming. I want to set up a simple home automation for my home.
I am using Sonoff equipment that I interface via the app and with Alexa's round the house but I want to learn more.
I want to re flash the Sonoffs and use MQTT and make more use of the equipment I already have.
